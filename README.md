# TournamentGenerator

This is intended to be a HEMA Tournament Management tool, which will be expanded with features as/when I need them. The tool is intended to be fully featured and OFFLINE. It manage a tournament from inception to closure, and export the results to HEMARatings csv files

Fight Management components are basic and not very customisable. Eventually, it should be possible to have a different set of Fight Management config options for each stage of the tournament (pool fights, eliminations, finals). Also "Advantage" rulesets and match point margins need to be included.

Pool seeding will be added when I decide how I want it to work.

The tool in its current 0.8.x version (i.e. a fully featured manager rather than pre 0.8 which was a generator) has managed a weighted target Swiss Pairs tournament, and a 2 pool round robin (with fights managed manually) - proved to work without issues each time.

Fancy features will be added when I feel like it. They will likely include (but will not be limited to) -

  - Graphical elimination brackets
  - Improved Excel export
  - Better logging and error handling
  - Better UI
  - Automatic update checking
  - Application options screen
  - Custom qualification sort fields
  - Better support of multi-client setups 
  - A logo
