# TournamentGenerator

This is intended to be a HEMA Tournament Management tool, which will be expanded with features as/when I need them.

Currently there is no "Fight Management" component, but it is possible to take a tournament from inception (fighter registrtion) to closure by inputting the fight results.

In progress is Swiss-Pair style Pools, with Round Robin style to follow shortly after.
