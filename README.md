# TournamentGenerator

This is intended to be a HEMA Tournament Management tool, which will be expanded with features as/when I need them. The tool is intended to be fully featured and OFFLINE. It manage a tournament from inception to closure, and export the results to HEMARatings csv files

Fight Management components are basic and not very customisable. Eventually, it should be possible to have a different set of Fight Management config options for each stage of the tournament (pool fights, eliminations, finals). Also "Advantage" rulesets and match point margins need to be included.

Pool seeding is very basic but does allow specific people to be placed into pools before a random shuffle takes place

The tool in its current 0.8.x version (i.e. a fully featured manager rather than pre 0.8 which was a generator) has managed a handful of different tournaments, mostly without issue.

Fancy features will be added when I feel like it. They will likely include (but will not be limited to) -

  - Graphical elimination brackets
  - Improved Excel export
  - Better logging and error handling
  - Better UI
  - Automatic update checking
  - Application options screen (that isn't just a .config file)
  - Custom qualification sort fields
  - Better support of multi-client setups ("merge results" functionality in progress which should accomodate this while still working entirely offline) 
  - A logo that doesn't suck
